        <h2>About the Website</h2>
        <p>This website was built with the goal of sharing thoughts, stories, and ideas in a space that feels personal yet accessible. Whether you're here to read, learn, or contribute — welcome.</p>
        <p>Created as a prefinal project for a web development course(Trends in Application Development), this blog features dynamic content, image uploads, and a clean, minimal design focused on the writing itself.</p>
        <p>All entries are stored in a MongoDB database and displayed using custom templates. From article previews to full entries, every piece of content is structured to enhance the reading experience.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore the site, read through the blogs, or even reach out if you’d like to collaborate. This platform is always evolving, just like the ideas it hosts.</p>
